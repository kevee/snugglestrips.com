    <h1>You meet someone awesome...</h1>
    <p>And things are going great, you both love the outdoors. Yay! Let's go backpacking. Night is coming, let's set up the tent.</p>
    <p>But it is cold out, and you have a Kelty sleeping bag and they have a North Face sleeping bags, and they have different zipper
      lengths and yours is a 7mm YKK plastic zipper and theirs is some weird off-brand custom zipper that's 5.5mm. So you must sleep alone,
      coccooned separately.<p>
    <h2>So just buy a Snuggle Strip™️!</h2>
    <p>It lets you join two incompatable sleeping bags together! Orders accepted sometime.</p>
